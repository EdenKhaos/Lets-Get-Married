## Project Description
A simple wedding planner app focusing on small or intimate weddings due to COVID 2020, that is forcing many couples to scale down their big day! This app is to make the rescaling to be focused on specific items such as budget, guest list, checklist items, venue, catering and lodging. A user will be allowed to create a private profile to save their lists to go back to later, as needed.
